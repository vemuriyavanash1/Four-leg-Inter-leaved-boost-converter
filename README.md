The objective of this project is to design and validate a four-leg interleaved DC–DC boost converter to achieve high voltage gain, reduced input/output current ripple, and minimized current stress on each switching device by over 50% through effective current sharing among phases. The converter employs phase-shifted PWM control for interleaved operation and is validated through LTspice and MATLAB/Simulink simulations, confirming stable voltage gain and enhanced efficiency for renewable energy and electric vehicle applications.

Simulation results:

 Output Voltage: 798 - 800V DC

 Voltage gain: ≈2

 Average Output power = (800^2/200) = 3.2KW

 Simulated efficiency = 98% (assuming low device and ESR losses)

 Input Current Ripple: Reduced by ≈ 60–70% compared to single-leg boost converter due to 90° phase-shifted interleaving.

 Inductor Current (per leg): Balanced across all four phases, each carrying ~¼ of total current.

 Output Voltage Ripple: < 2–3% peak-to-peak with total 50 µF capacitance.

 Conclusion:

 The four-leg interleaved DC–DC boost converter successfully achieved high-voltage step-up (400 V → ~800 V) with improved efficiency and reduced ripple.

 Interleaving operation effectively balanced current among phases, reducing inductor and switch current stress by over 50%.

 Parallel capacitor configuration (4 × 12.5 µF) minimized ESR, leading to stable output voltage and low ripple.

 The design demonstrated strong potential for use in renewable energy systems, EV DC–link converters, and DC microgrids requiring low ripple, high efficiency, and robust power delivery.
